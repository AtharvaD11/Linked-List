Solution : 

```

/* Function to delete a given node from the list */
void deleteNode(struct Node **head, int key){
    Node* prev = NULL;
    Node* curr = *head;
    while(curr->data != key){
        prev = curr;
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    prev->next = curr->next;
    delete curr;
}

/* Function to reverse the linked list */
 void reverse(struct Node** head_ref){
    Node* prev = *head_ref;
    Node* curr = (*head_ref)->next;
    while(curr != *head_ref){
        Node* temp = curr->next;
        curr->next = prev;
        prev= curr;
        curr = temp;
    }
    curr->next = prev;
    *head_ref = prev;
}
