Problem Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-even-length-groups/

Problem Statement : You are given the head of a linked list.

The nodes in the linked list are sequentially assigned to non-empty groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...).<br> The length of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,

The 1st node is assigned to the first group.<br>
The 2nd and the 3rd nodes are assigned to the second group.<br>
The 4th, 5th, and 6th nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.<br>
Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to 1 + the length of the second to last group.


Reverse the nodes in each group with an even length, and return the head of the modified linked list.

### Solution : Thaka diya
Pre-requisite : Reverse LL in groups of k
